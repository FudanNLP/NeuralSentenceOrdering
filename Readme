An python (with theano) based implementation of Paper "Neural sentence ordering".

The data is available on https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-mnK8kniGAiNVB6WTQ4bmdyamc.

The sample of processed data could be found on https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-mnK8kniGAiSWhaR3gyalJyQm8/view?usp=sharing. And users should put this *.gz file into ./data/ to run the code.
This processed data is based only a toy way to organize data in order to make the code run.

The entrance of the code is ./src/driver.py

Any usage of our code, data or idea could cite the paper "Neural sentence ordering" on arXiv .
